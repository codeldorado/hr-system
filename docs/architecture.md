# HR Platform Infrastructure Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the cloud infrastructure architecture for an Italian HR platform serving 100,000 active users with daily work hour tracking. The architecture addresses scalability challenges during peak traffic periods (8-10am, 5-7pm) and traffic spikes during public holidays and month-end closures.

## Architecture Decision: Microservices vs Monolith

**Decision: Microservices Architecture**

**Rationale:**
- **Scalability**: Individual services can scale independently based on demand patterns
- **Resilience**: Failure isolation prevents system-wide outages
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can develop and deploy services independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Services can use optimal technology stacks
- **Performance**: Critical services (authentication, time tracking) can be optimized separately

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- Increased operational complexity (mitigated by AWS managed services)
- Network latency between services (addressed through service mesh and caching)
- Data consistency challenges (handled through event-driven architecture)
