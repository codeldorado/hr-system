# Integration Guide: Payslip Microservice in HR Platform Architecture

This guide explains how the Payslip Microservice integrates with the broader HR platform architecture designed in Part 1, including authentication, authorization, and service communication patterns.

## Architecture Integration Overview

The Payslip Microservice is designed as part of a comprehensive microservices-based HR platform that serves 100,000+ active users. It integrates seamlessly with the overall architecture through well-defined interfaces and communication patterns.


## Authentication and Authorization Integration

### JWT Token-Based Authentication

The Payslip Microservice integrates with the central Authentication Service through JWT tokens:

#### Token Validation Flow
1. **Client Request**: Frontend sends request with JWT token
2. **Token Validation**: Payslip service validates token with Auth service
3. **User Context**: Extract user information and permissions
4. **Authorization Check**: Verify user can access requested resources
5. **Response**: Return data or error based on authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### User Roles and Permissions

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Employee** | - View own payslips<br>- Upload own payslips (if enabled) |
| **HR Manager** | - View all payslips<br>- Upload payslips for any employee<br>- Generate reports |
| **Administrator** | - Full CRUD operations<br>- System configuration<br>- User management |
| **Auditor** | - Read-only access to all payslips<br>- Access audit logs |

## Service Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

#### REST API Integration
The Payslip Microservice exposes REST APIs that integrate with other services:

### Asynchronous Communication

#### Event-Driven Architecture
The service publishes events for other services to consume.

## API Gateway Integration

### Centralized Routing
The Payslip Microservice integrates through AWS API Gateway:

```yaml
# API Gateway Configuration
paths:
  /api/v1/payslips:
    post:
      x-amazon-apigateway-integration:
        type: http_proxy
        httpMethod: POST
        uri: http://payslip-alb.amazonaws.com/payslips
        requestParameters:
          integration.request.header.X-User-ID: context.authorizer.user_id
          integration.request.header.X-User-Role: context.authorizer.role
```

### Rate Limiting and Throttling
```yaml
# Rate limiting configuration
x-amazon-apigateway-throttle:
  burstLimit: 1000
  rateLimit: 500

# Per-user rate limiting
x-amazon-apigateway-request-validator: "Validate body, query string parameters, and headers"
```

## Data Consistency and Transactions

### Database Integration Patterns

#### Shared Database Anti-Pattern Avoidance
Each microservice maintains its own database while sharing necessary data through APIs:

#### Eventual Consistency
Handle data consistency through event-driven updates:

## Monitoring and Observability Integration

### Distributed Tracing
Integration with AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing:

### Centralized Logging
Integration with centralized logging system:

## Security Integration

### Network Security
Integration with VPC and security groups:

```hcl
# Security group allowing communication between services
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "payslip_to_auth" {
  type                     = "egress"
  from_port                = 443
  to_port                  = 443
  protocol                 = "tcp"
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.auth_service.id
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.payslip_service.id
}
```

### Secrets Management
Integration with AWS Secrets Manager:

## Deployment Integration

### Service Discovery
Integration with AWS ECS service discovery:

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
Integration with Redis for performance optimization:

## Error Handling and Circuit Breaker

### Resilience Patterns
Implementation of circuit breaker pattern for external service calls.

## Testing Integration

### Contract Testing
Ensure API compatibility with other services.
